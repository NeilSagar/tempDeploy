    "The ACFT is a comprehensive assessment used to evaluate the physical fitness of soldiers in the U.S. Army, forming part of the Army's Holistic Health and Fitness System.",
    "As of April 2022, the ACFT includes the Three-Repetition Maximum Deadlift, Standing Power Throw, Hand-Release Push-Up, Sprint-Drag-Carry, Plank Hold, and Two-Mile Run.",
    "A soldier must score a minimum of 60 points in each of the six events, with a maximum total score of 600 points possible. The score for each event is added to determine the final ACFT score.",
    "The Plank Hold, introduced in the latest ACFT version, is used for core-strength testing, replacing the Leg Tuck event.",
    "The redesigned ACFT was implemented on April 1, 2022, following extensive evaluation and feedback.",
    "The latest ACFT version includes age and gender performance-normed scoring, a 2.5-mile walk as an additional aerobic event, and the Plank Hold as the sole core-strength exercise.",
    "The change to an age and gender-normed scoring system was based on comprehensive data analysis and aimed to ensure a fair assessment across all Army elements.",
    "Soldiers must score at least 60 points in each event, totaling a minimum of 360 points across all six events, to pass the ACFT.",
    "The Leg Tuck was removed after studies indicated that it wasn't a reliable measure of core strength for all soldiers and that the Plank provides a more accurate assessment.",
    "The ACFT Scoring Scales can be found on the U.S. Army's official website and are also integrated into the ACFT Calculator and ACFT Score Viewer for easy access."
